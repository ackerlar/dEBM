# dEBM
dEBM is a surface melt scheme to couple ice and climate models in paleo applications. 
dEBMmain takes near surface air temperature (^oC) and downward short wave radiation (monthly mean of daily means flux in W/m2),
albedo and latitude as input, 
and calls all the necessary routines to calculate melt rates in mm/day.
Note that (for simplicity) the calendar is modern and declination for a given date is only approximated in a very simple way 
(it does not matter too much, but surely this can be improved).
a full surface mass balance model is on its way and may be published soon.\\
