# dEBM
dEBM is a surface melt scheme to couple ice and climate models in paleo applications 
dEBMmain takes near surface air temperature () and downward short wave radiation (monthly mean of daily means flux in W/m2) 
as input
and calls all the necessary routines to calculate melt rates in mm/day
note that the calendar is modern
