The diurnal Energy Balance Model (dEBM)
======

The diurnal Energy Balance Model (dEBM) is an surface mass balance model of intermediate complexity. It provides a novel interface between atmosphere and land ice for Earth System modelling. In contrast to empirical schemes, dEBM accounts for changes in the Earth's orbit and atmospheric composition. The scheme only requires monthly atmospheric forcing (precipitation, temperature, shortwave and longwave radiation and cloud cover) and is computationally inexpensive, which makes it particularly suitable to investigate the response of ice sheets to long term climate change.

Installation
=============

1. get the code :
   git clone https://github.com/ukrebska/dEBM/tree/update/Fortran-v1.0 dEBM   
   cd dEBM

2. prepare the input:
   
   EXAMPLE input files: test.nc (include air_temp precipitation cc swd TOAswd emiss tau q2m)

   edit namelist of dEBM:
      vi namelist.dEBM:
          & dEBM : filename_in='test.nc'

   path for the results:
   ./

3. compile the code:
   
   make comp

4. run the model:
   
   make run

5. investigate the results:
   output: surface_mass_balance.nc
   restart: restart_debm.nc
